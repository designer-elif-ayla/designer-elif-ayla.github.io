                <p>My name is Elif Ayla, and I am a master student İnteractive Digital Media at Griffith College.After my law undergraduate education in 2013, I've completed my internship and I've worked professionally as a lawyer for 5 years.
                  Afterwards, I moved to Dublin in 2018 to get language training, as my research and education was based on English-based resources.
                  I wanted to make a radical change in my profession and combine my desire to discover new field with a global profession.</p>
                <p>The effort to exist in a foreign country with insufficient language knowledge has made me different and mature.
                  But I have been feeling more strong like Lao Tzu said that"It is powerful who beats others; The one who defeats itself is stronger!"</p>
